## Core Functionality

### Homepage

Located in `homepage.dart`, the homepage manages the bottom navigation bar and allows switching between the Shop page and Cart page. It also includes a custom navigation drawer with options like "Home" and "About".

- **Bottom Navigation**: A dynamic navigation bar implemented through the `MyBottomNavBar` widget, enabling users to toggle between different app pages (`Shoppage`, `Cartpage`).
- **Navigation Drawer**: Offers quick access to "Home", "About", and "Logout" actions.

### Shop Page

The shop page (`shoppage.dart`) displays the product listing (shoes) and allows users to add items to their cart.

- **Product List**: Displays a list of trending products, called "Hot Picks", using the `Shoetile` component.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add items to their cart, with a confirmation dialog appearing after successful addition.
- **Provider Integration**: Uses the Provider package to manage state. The `Cart` model tracks added items.

### Cart Page

The cart page (`cartpage.dart`) shows a list of products that users have added to their cart.

- **Dynamic Cart**: The cart list dynamically updates based on the items users have added, and uses the `Cartitem` component to display each item.
- **State Management**: The `Cart` model holds the cart's state and updates the UI accordingly.

### Main.dart

The `main.dart` file initializes the app and sets up the `Provider` for state management.

- **Cart Provider**: A `ChangeNotifierProvider` wraps the app to provide access to the `Cart` model across different pages.
- **App Entry**: The app begins by loading the `Intropage()` as the home screen, giving an introductory view of the app.
